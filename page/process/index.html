        <p>We maintain a feedback driven cycle throughout the whole development process. Essentially, this means that 
        as we build products, we also test them to spot bugs early on and optimize production time. In addition, we 
        keep you informed on the status of your products and can adjust them according to any needs that may arise along the way.</p>
