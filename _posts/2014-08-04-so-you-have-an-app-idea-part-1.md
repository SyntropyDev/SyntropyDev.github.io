The flash of inspiration has struck. You've found your great idea for an app or website. Now what? Over the course of our 3-part "So You Have an App Idea" series we'll cover how to evaluate, implement, and learn from your ideas to help you build the next great thing. First up: how to evaluate and refine your idea.

##Define your goals
It may seem obvious, but people often don't define what they want until the project is already underway. Knowing what you hope to achieve is the first step to achieving it. Here's some starting points to get you thinking about your goals. 

Are you looking to build a business or is it more of a side project? Are you attempting to fill a market need or creating a new market altogether? Are you building a product for others to use, or scratching your own itch? Does it need to be done tomorrow, or can it wait a few months?

Try to be realistic about what you need versus things that are nice to have. For example, everyone wants their project done tomorrow, but those that keep a more realistic timeline typically get higher quality work while keeping their options open.

##Take inventory
Building software isn't easy, it takes time, money, and effort. Think about how much you're realistically able and willing to commit. Keep in mind, there's no right or wrong answer â€“ these questions are just to help put things in perspective.
 
* How much time are you able to invest? 
* What does your budget look like? 
* What kind of skills and talents do you have that could help?
* What other resources do you have at your disposal? 

##Examine the stakeholders
Most ideas don't exist in isolation. Is there anyone you need to work with in order to meet your goals? Are there any other stakeholders or partners that should be involved?

##Determine a value proposition
Finally, you've got to answer the big question: what problem are you solving? It can be difficult to answer concisely, but knowing your value proposition is critically important to the success of your venture. If you know the problem you hope to solve, you can know when you've solved it. 

* What market do you aim to serve?
* Why will people use this?
* Why are you the best person for the job? 
* Is there anything out there like your idea already? 
* How is your idea different?
