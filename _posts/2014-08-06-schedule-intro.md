Historically, people formed their schedules as a reaction to other constraints in their lives. You typically didn't have much choice in your daily routine. Your job dictated your schedule. Lucky for us, however, we live in the age of Facetime and Wifi. 

In tech a lot of us have jobs that can be done remotely and asynchronously due to the productivity and communication tools we use & our expertise at using them. This puts us in the enviable situation of being able to optimize our routine and tailor it to suit our natural dispositions.

I figured a good starting point would be to mimic the daily routines of a few individuals widely regarded as highly effective. I don't know how to track quantitative metrics about a schedules performance in daily life, so I'll be writing some notes about my interpretation of the key points of each, and my experience sticking to them for a week.

Get ready, because week one is all about Paul Graham.
