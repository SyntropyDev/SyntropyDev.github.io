People typically formed their schedules as a reaction to other constraints in their lives. Historically, you didn't have much choice in your daily routine. Your job dictated your schedule. 

In tech a lot of us have jobs that can be done remotely and asynchronously due to the productivity and communication tools we use & our expertise at using them. This puts us in the enviable situation of being able to optimize our routine and tailor it to suit our natural dispositions.

I figured a good starting point would be to mimic the daily routines of a few individuals widely regarded as highly effective. I don't know how to track quantitative metrics about a schedules performance in daily life, so I'll be writing some notes about my interpretation of the key points of each, and my experience sticking to them for a week.

Get ready, because week one is all about Paul Graham.
