After starting at WVU in 2010, Sam immersed himself in the LCSEE Computer Science program and various school sponsored programming and business challenges. 

At WVU's Operation App Launch Sam began developing apps for iOS and met fellow programmer and GWSH alum Logan Spears. Shortly thereafter, Sam and Logan cofounded their first software company along with longtime friend Ricky Kirkendall. This company was Floco Apps LLC. 

From 2010 to 2012 Sam continued his work developing mobile and web software for all types of companies and organizations with Floco. In 2012 Sam and Ricky started another venture, Campaignr LLC to simplify the realm of digital fundraising for nonprofits, political campaigns and other causes. 

In May of 2014 Sam joined Syntropy LLC to better promote the principles of pragmatism in software and compassionate engineering. His work at Syntropy is focused primarily around user experience design, application design, web development, strategic planning and kicking ass.
